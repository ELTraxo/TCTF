Welcome to the Console Trainer Template repository. This project is designed to serve as a starting point for creating your own game trainers.

What is a Console Trainer?
-----------------------

A game trainer is a program that modifies the data in a computer's memory to allow a player to cheat in a computer game. They can manipulate various game data, such as player health, ammunition, lives, levels, and even game speed. Trainers are typically used in single-player games, where the use of cheats does not impact other players.

About This Project
------------------

This project is written in C++, a powerful and versatile programming language that is particularly well-suited to tasks like game hacking due to its low-level capabilities. The project is structured as a console application, which makes it easy to interact with and debug.

C++ Console Trainer Template Structure
-----------------

The main components of this project are:

-   `ConsoleColor.h`: Contains definitions for console colors. This allows the console output to be color-coded for better readability.
-   `Hack.cpp` and `Hack.h`: Contains the main logic for the hack or cheat that the trainer is implementing. This is where the magic happens!
-   `HexStr.h`: Contains utility functions for dealing with hexadecimal strings. Hexadecimal is often used in game hacking due to its close relationship with binary, which is the language of computers.
-   `Memory.cpp` and `Memory.h`: Contains functions for reading and writing to memory. This is a fundamental part of any game trainer, as it is through manipulating memory that cheats are implemented.
-   `Menu.cpp` and `Menu.h`: Contains the logic for the console menu that users interact with. This makes it easy for users to select and activate cheats.
-   `Trainer.cpp` and `Trainer.h`: Contains the main logic for the trainer, tying together the other components.
-   `Traxo.h`: (Purpose not immediately clear without further context)
-   `includes.h`: Contains include directives for the other header files in the project. This is a common practice in C++ to keep code organized and avoid circular dependencies.
-   `main.cpp`: The entry point for the program. This is where execution begins when the program is run.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with this project, you will need a C++ IDE such as Visual Studio. Clone the repository, open the solution file in your IDE, and start exploring! You can modify the existing components or add new ones to create your own game trainer.

What is a memory class?
-----
This console trainer template provides simple methods for reading from and writing to memory. These methods would use system calls to access the memory of another process (like a game). A memory class might also provide methods for finding the addresses of specific pieces of data in memory, which is often necessary for writing a trainer.
